## 📢 Introduction
People with disabilities often face significant challenges in their daily transportation, not only due to inadequate facilities but also a lack of necessary information. PathPal is a pioneering initiative aimed at addressing this critical issue of mobility and information accessibility.

We selected this project to highlight the urgent need for comprehensive solutions to these transportation challenges. PathPal represents our commitment to enhance both physical mobility and information accessibility for people with disabilities through community service and technology.

Offering a platform where volunteers can provide safe transportation and walking assistance, PathPal hopes to significantly ease the daily mobility challenges faced by these individuals and bridge the information gap.
